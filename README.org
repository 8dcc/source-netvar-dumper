*NetVar offset dumper for source games in Linux.*

#+TOC: headlines 2

* Description
Uses netvars to get the offsets of classes in a source game. It writes to =stdout=
and to =/tmp/source-netvar-dumper.log=.

* Configuring
You might need to change the following settings depending on your source game:
- The process name should be changed from the =process_name= variable in [[https://github.com/8dcc/source-netvar-dumper/blob/main/inject.sh][inject.sh]]
- Relative location to =client.so= should be changed from the =CLIENT_SO= define in
  [[https://github.com/8dcc/source-netvar-dumper/blob/main/src/main.c][src/main.c]]
- The vtable index of the =GetAllClasses= function inside =IBaseClientDLL=. For
  black mesa it's *index 10*, for csgo it's *index 8* afaik.

* Building

#+begin_src console
